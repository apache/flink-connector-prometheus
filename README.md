## Modules

This repository contains the following modules

* [Prometheus Connector](./flink-connector-prometheus): Flink Prometheus Connector implementation; supports optional
  request signer
* [Sample application](./example-datastream-job): Sample application showing the usage of the connector with DataStream
  API. It also demonstrates how to configure the request signer.

## Building the Apache Flink Prometheus Connector from Source

Prerequisites:

* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X)
* Git
* Maven (we recommend version 3.8.6)
* Java 11

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-prometheus.git
cd flink-connector-prometheus
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

The resulting jars can be found in the `target` directory of the respective module.

## Developing Flink

The Flink committers use IntelliJ IDEA to develop the Flink codebase.
We recommend IntelliJ IDEA for developing projects that involve Scala code.

Minimal requirements for an IDE are:

* Support for Java and Scala (also mixed projects)
* Support for Maven with Java and Scala

### IntelliJ IDEA

The IntelliJ IDE supports Maven out of the box and offers a plugin for Scala development.

* IntelliJ download: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* IntelliJ Scala Plugin: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347)
